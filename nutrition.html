        <h1> Our Emphasis on Nutrition </h1>
        <p> At SMEK Fitness group, we emphasize to our athletes that their self improvement doesn't end when they walk out the doors. We offer nutritionist consultations, on-site healthy options, and info sources such as this one to give you all the information you need to reach all your fitness goals. </p>
        
        <h3> Eating Healthy </h3>
        <p> Most people have heard of the five major food groups, but they don't neccessarily know how to incorperate them effectively into their own diet. Below is a summary of each: </p>
        <ul style="padding-left: 100px;">
                <li><strong>Carbohydrates </strong> are broken by your body into glucose and use to provide you body with energy. Eating high fiber, complex carbs will provide you with more longlasting energy throughout your day. Simple carbs like fruit snacks can still be good as a quick pre-workout pick me up, but they won't do you any good after two hours. <br>&emsp;<i>Includes grains, oats, pasta, bread.</i></li>
                <li><strong>Proteins </strong> are used by your body to repair damaged muscles and, if carb sources are depleted, for basic energy. You really want your body to be able to build upon the muscle it has, so eating enough protein is important to make sure you see success in your workouts. <br>&emsp;<i> Includes meats, seafood, legumes, and dairy.</i></li>
                <li><strong>Fats </strong> are neccessary for a healthy diet. Your body relies on them for absorbtion of vitamins and hormone regulation. Your body relies on Vitamins A, B, C, D, and zinc to function fluidly, so making sure you're eating enough healthy fats is essential for skin and hair health. <br>&emsp;<i> Indludes nuts, avacado, and natural oils.</i></li>
                <li><strong>Fruits </strong> are a great source of many of the nutrients described above. They're also a quick and easy carb to eat right before or even mid-workout. Drinking smoothies, adding some orange juice to your daily breakfast, or grilling peaches alongside your chicken can be a great way for you to work fruits into your diet. <br>&emsp;<i> Includes fruits, berries, and juices.</i></li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables </strong> provide us with antioxidants and phytochemicals, which help the body recover from structural damge and keep all our organs functioning smoothly. <br>&emsp;<i> Includes, broccoli, kale, sprouts, and </i> </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Eating Right </h3>
        <p> With that general knowledge, you also have to know how to apply those guidelines to your own body, lifestyle, and fitness goals. Athletes tend to have higher deman for carbohydrates -- to give themselves energy for workouts -- and protein -- to replenish their muscles after they've been depleted. If you don't provide your body with enough energy from the sources it wants, it will start pulling energy from the muscles you want to recover, so staying aware of what you're eating is essential for growth in the weight room. </p>
        <p> Fortunately for you, we've provided a serving calculator below so you can know exactly how much of each food group your body needs. Just input the relevant information and find out how you can personalize your diet.</p>

        <h3> Performance Enhancers </h3>
        <p> Most people can meet their nutritional needs through food alone, however, if you feel thay you aren't able to do this, dietary supplements or performance enhancers can help you reach your fitness goals. These typically include vitamins and minerals, which you can find in most daily vitamins. Many athletes also choose to intake extra amino acids for workout performance and recovery. </p>
        <p> To get the most out of your workouts, you could try taking pre-workout to make sure you have the energy and endurance to make the most out of your time in the gym. We offer a version of this on <a href="products.html"> our products page </a>. We also offer creative, which is frequently recommended for 30 minutes pre-workout, although it's safe to take it whenever. Creatine is an amino acid derivative that has been shown to improve athletic performance by boosting your ability for explosive excercise. Check it out in our <a href="products.html"> store</a>, and speak with one of our nutritionists if you'd like to know more about how and when to take it. </p>
        <p> Often, it's difficult to give your body enough protein for recovery, so adding a post-workout protein powder can be a great idea. This can be especialy important for vegan or vegetarian athletes. Lots of protein powders take protein from whey, but if that doesn't align with your dietary choices, there are many alternative protein options out there such as hemp or pea protein. </p>
